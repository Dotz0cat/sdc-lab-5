# SDC Lab 5 Spring Boot

Yes if you are reading this readme I did add it after the deadline.
I was running out of time for this lab.

To run the project,
I recommend to open it with the intellij Idea IDE and run the DemoApplication class.
This should start spring boot.

You can also start this by using `mvn package` and `mvn spring-boot:run`.

I have a index page at the root.

I have a basic page at /page.

I also have buttons at /buttons.
Here you can enter a value in the text field and have it appear under it when you click submit.
